## Every Layout with Svelte

This is a quick'n'dirty implementation of the publicly available layouts on https://every-layout.dev

You should buy the book :) You can then use this repo as a starting point to implement the rest
(it's rather simple, actually).

The idea for passing CSS vars with `style` to have dynamic CSS comes from [What I Like About Writing Styles with Svelte](https://css-tricks.com/what-i-like-about-writing-styles-with-svelte/).

### What's here

**CSS**

- [Modern CSS reset](https://hankchizljaw.com/wrote/a-modern-css-reset/) (see App.svelte styles)
- [Measure](https://absolutely.every-layout.dev/rudiments/axioms/)
- [Modular scale](https://absolutely.every-layout.dev/rudiments/modular-scale/)

**Layout**

- [Stack](https://every-layout.dev/layouts/stack/)
- [Sidebar](https://every-layout.dev/layouts/sidebar/)
- [Cover](https://every-layout.dev/layouts/cover/)

Components have the same API as the custom components in the book.

### Screenshot

- A composition showcase from `App.svelte`
- All elements have their width constrained to `60ch` (see [Measure](https://every-layout.dev/rudiments/axioms/)).
